    #
    # Is it better to use

    # or
    #    obj == nil
    # Why?

    # Comment from Brian:
    # It is better to use obj.nil? because it is more readable, concise, and less
    # error-prone than using == (which can be accidentally written as =).
    # Additionally, the behavior of .nil? can be changed, as it can be
    # overwritten by a class. =='s behavior can not be changed.
