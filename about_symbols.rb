  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why do we convert the list of symbols to strings and then compare
  # against the string value rather than against symbols?

  # Comment from Brian:
  # If you use a symbol instead of a string as input for the 
  # .include? Method, it will always evaluate to true because the very act
  # of typing that symbol as an input will add it to the Symbol table, therefore
  # any symbol you input will always be included and found as true. However, by
  # using strings, the string you use as input will not be added to the Symbol
  # table that you are checking into, which will enable the .include? Method to
  # truly evaluate whether the name you input (as a string) actually
  # exists in the Symbol table.

  # THINK ABOUT IT:

  # Why is it not a good idea to dynamically create a lot of symbols?

  # Comment from Brian:
  # Creating a lot of symbols will have a high amount of memory consumption
  # and require additional processing overhead, as the system needs to manage
  # the memory. Dynamically creating a lot of symbols may also inadvertently 
  # overwrite existing symbols. Furthermore, they are difficult to track for debugging
  # purposes.
